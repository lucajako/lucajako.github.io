excerpt: 'We assess the feasibility of a partially in-kernel anomaly-based intrusion detection system that uses machine learning and a packet sampling policy to keep pace with network traffic. Using the same dataset as the inference stage, we identify a sampling threshold that maintains high precision and recall. Throughput tests on a two-middlebox testbed stressed with iperf3 show that the proposed system performs efficiently and is suitable for deployment.'

Extended Berkeley Packet Filter technology has been successfully used to accelerate several data-plane algorithms. An application area of growing interest is Intrusion Detection, where timely packet processing at high speed is critical. In this paper, we focus on anomaly detection, which uses machine learning to identify packets belonging to a malicious flow with the intervention of a packet sampling policy to keep up with the traffic network pace in a kernel-to-user-space pipeline, to investigate the deployment feasibility of the designed anomaly-based kernel-enhanced intrusion detection system. The performance tests related to the packet sampling policy have been carried out taking into account the same dataset used to test the inference algorithm, establishing a packet sampling rate threshold maintaining a high accuracy. The throughput measurements have been tried out on our testbed composed by two back-to-back connected programmable middlebox leveraging on the iperf3 tool to employ the stress test, validating that our designed network intrusion detection system is suitable for deployment.
