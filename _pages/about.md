## Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Information Technology & research assistant at Politecnico di Milano, where I obtained my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering in 2023.

I am currently working at [BONSAILab](https://www.bonsai.deib.polimi.it/) and my research topics have the goal to enhance network security in 5G networks. In particular, I am interested in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), network packet sampling policies, applied cryptography, and network traffic steering.

Outside of work, I have many interests. Some of them are competing in arm wrestling, enjoying running half marathons, and working out using powerlifting exercises.
